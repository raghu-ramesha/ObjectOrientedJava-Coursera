I knew some time ago that the life I was living was not what I wanted for myself. I was on my way to becoming a successful music teacher which an $80,000 per year income on offer. I had nearly finished university and was ready for a ‘happy’ comfortable life teaching private school kids how to play the oboe.
I knew that this path didn’t line up with the path I truly wanted but I was crippled with the fear of risking everything to find it.
I was constantly waring with myself, torn between what my family and friends wanted and expected me to do, and what I truly wanted to do inside.
Long story short, I turned down my head teacher position and traveled to China and back.
I was full of fear from the very start months leading up to leaving my home country for a foreign land.
So many things could happen, so many negative possibilities and realities.
I feared:
Rejection Loss of money No stability Humiliation Ultimate failure Ridicule from people who never believed I could do it
But that never stopped me from going and I am so happy for it.
I will leave you with this quote.
“Everything you want is on the other side of fear.” – Jack Canfield
Live life fearlessly, be bold, be courageous and i’ll see your beautiful self on the other side.
(This is something I wrote about on my blog and I thought it might motivate you.)
