## Module 3 Programming Assignment was COOOL!

Module 3  Programming Assignment of this course was an interesting one and really gives us practice to work with *object oriented code*. 

###### Assignment Objectives
The assignment had 3 fundamental objectives.
* Add markers to the map
* Customize the markers according to magnitude
* Provide a key

The skeleton code was especially helpful for this assignment. I took some time to learn from it and without it the assignment wouldn't have been possible but it indeed made some things easier. 

As written in the assignment I took time to understand the Classes which were seeming so strange at the very first. These are the classes which were very new according to me in this assignment
    * PointFeature
    * SimplePointMarker
    * Marker (had some familiarity from the the class I implemented while watching the course videos)
    
After understanding the skeleton code and the above mentioned classes the coding was just a matter of taking simple steps. The *helper method* `createMarker()` gave me an idea how can I modularize my code better. I also created another helper method called `createMarkers()` which *returned ArrayList<Marker>* and this called `createMarker()`.

** createMarker() further implementation ** 
Using the properties in PointFeature I stylized the SimplePointMarker for each earthquake. According to the specifications. 

 

### Approximate Time taken: 2.5 hours


** Luckily I completed all of the objectives **

Here's a screen shot of the Assignment version matching the one in the specification
